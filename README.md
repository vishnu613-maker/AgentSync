AgentSync is an intelligent multi-agent system that lets multiple AI agents (Email, Calendar, Tasks) work together seamlessly by sharing memory and context. Instead of each agent working alone and forgetting information, AgentSync helps them coordinate—so you don't enter the same information twice, agents don't create conflicting schedules, and nothing gets lost between email, calendar, and tasks.
